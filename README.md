# Welcome to dx-react!

Generate react things with just a command. 

For beginnings, lets install the npm package.

    npm i -g dx-react

## Component

Generate a new component from your terminal

    dx-react -c YOUR_NAME

Thats it. It will do its magic. It will generate a file with custom Component code, like this :
